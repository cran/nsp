Description: Implementation of Narrowest Significance Pursuit, a general and
    flexible methodology for automatically detecting localised regions in data sequences
    which each must contain a change-point (understood as an abrupt change in the
    parameters of an underlying linear model), at a prescribed global significance level.
    Narrowest Significance Pursuit works with a wide range of distributional assumptions
    on the errors, and yields exact desired finite-sample coverage probabilities,
    regardless of the form or number of the covariates. For details, see P. Fryzlewicz
